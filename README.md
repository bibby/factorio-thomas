# Really Useful Engines for Factorio

This mod adds additional locomotives to [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) 0.15.x .

Each has their own whistle, and talk if you linger near.


## Changelog

### 0.0.2 - 3 Dec 2017

- Dialog for all trains
- Shortened shadows
- Scaled down Percy, was oversized

### 0.0.1 - 29 Nov 2017

- First public access
- Train sprites and sounds for Thomas, Gordon, and Percy

## TODO
- Scans around players[1], so talk probably isn't multi-player friendly
