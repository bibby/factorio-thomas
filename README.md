# Really Useful Engines for Factorio

This mod adds additional locomotives to [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) 0.15.x .

Each has their own whistle, and some may talk if you linger near.

## TODO

- Emily, Spencer, and James have no dialog.
- Percy and Gordon could use more dialog.
- Scans around players[1], so talk probably isn't multi-player friendly
